- Hands-on labs reinforce concepts, allowing you to apply Git workflows in your own projects.
- Practice resolving merge conflicts, writing effective pull requests, and setting up GitHub Actions.

### Best Practices for Git and GitHub
- Maintain clean repositories using `.gitignore`, squashing commits, and writing clear commit messages.
- Explore workflows like Gitflow, feature branching, and trunk-based development, and choose the best approach for your projects.
- Learn guidelines for contributing to open-source projects, including issue tracking, code reviews, and community contribution.

## Why Learn Git and GitHub?

Git and GitHub are indispensable tools in modern software development. Git allows you to track code changes, collaborate with others, and experiment without affecting the main project. GitHub builds on this by offering a platform for hosting repositories, remote collaboration, and integrating with tools for seamless version control.

Mastering Git and GitHub will enhance your ability to manage code, collaborate effectively, and contribute to open-source projects. Leveraging AI-powered tools like GitHub Copilot will also streamline your workflow, keeping you ahead in the fast-paced tech industry.
