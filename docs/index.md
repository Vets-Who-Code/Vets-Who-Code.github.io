# Vets Who Code Engineering Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

A veteran transitioning into software engineering through Vets Who Code...

* Has responsibilities to their unit â€“ mentor, coach, and lead.
* Knows their **SOPs**. Follows their SOPs. Improves their SOPs if they are inefficient. If they find better SOPs, they incorporate them. If somebody could use their SOPs, they share them.
* Leads by example. Models the behaviors we desire both interpersonally and technically.
* Strives to understand how their work fits into a broader context and ensures mission success.

These are our Standard Operating Procedures for Software Engineering Core Fundamentals. All contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a pull request to get involved.

## Why Have SOPs

* To increase overall efficiency for the entire Vets Who Code community.
* To reduce the number of errors and avoid common pitfalls in the transition of becoming software engineers.
* To strive to be better engineers and learn from shared experiences so we can flatten each others growth curve.
* To establish a consistent, high-quality approach to software development tasks.

If you do nothing else, follow the Engineering Fundamentals Checklist! (Link to be added)
